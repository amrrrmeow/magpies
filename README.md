📏_**Average wing and tail length visualization of Eurasian magpie subspecies Pica pica**_

This code is designed to visualize the average wing and tail length of different subspecies of the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica). The geographic variability of this species is not well-studied, and this code aims to contribute to our understanding of the subspecies diversity in different regions.

🗺_**Why study geographic variability?**_

Studying the geographic variability of subspecies is important for several reasons. 

🕊_Firstly_, it provides valuable information for conservation efforts, as different subspecies may have different conservation needs based on their geographic location. Understanding the differences in wing and tail length between subspecies can help in determining which populations are most at risk and require urgent conservation actions.

🕊_Secondly_, studying geographic variability can also provide insights into the evolutionary processes and natural selection within different regions. By understanding the differences in physical characteristics between subspecies, researchers can gain a better understanding of how adaptation occurs in response to environmental factors.

🕊_Lastly_, studying geographic variability can also have implications for other scientific fields, such as biogeography, ecology, and evolutionary biology. It can help in understanding how different subspecies interact with their environment, the distribution patterns of different subspecies, and their roles in ecosystem functioning.

🖦_**How to use the code**_

This code uses data on wing and tail length measurements from different subspecies of Eurasian magpies. The data is visualized using graphical representations such as scatter plots and histograms to show the average wing and tail length of each subspecies.

The code is written in Python and uses popular data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. It is designed to be easily customizable, allowing researchers to input their own data and analyze the geographic variability of different subspecies.

_**Contribution**_

This code aims to contribute to the broader understanding of the geographic variability of subspecies within the Eurasian magpie. By visualizing the average wing and tail length of different subspecies, it provides a starting point for further research and analysis in this understudied area.
